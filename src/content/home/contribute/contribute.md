# Note on Icons
For the `icon` field in both `developmentLinks` and `communityLinks`, use the Font Awesome 6 icon names without the "fa-" prefix. 
Use "fa6-brands:" for brand icons (e.g., "github", "telegram") and "fa6-solid:" for solid icons (e.g., "comments").
Examples:
- For GitHub: use "github" (it will be prefixed with "fa6-brands:")
- For comments: use "comments" (it will be prefixed with "fa6-solid:")
