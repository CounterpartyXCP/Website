SogParty winning first place, CounterTools second and XCP DEX third place.

## Prizes

The community prize was entirely dependent on community donations, with our co-founder Robby Dermody matching donations 1:1. Community members were able to donate to the pool by sending XCP to the following address: 1NkRncAvsbYyFD3qZUCxqmupbvPKHHJASe. Since the total amount of XCP donated was **609.8**, the final amount in the pool available for community prizes is **1219.6 XCP**.

This means that:

1.  **First Prize** and **608.9 XCP** goes to **SoGParty**
2.  **Second prize** and **457.35 XCP** goes to **CounterTools**
3.  **Third prize** and **152.45 XCP** goes to **XCP DEX**

The main prize, awarded by the panel is **7,500 XCP** and will be awarded as follows:

1.  **First place** and **6,000 XCP** will be awarded to **CounterTools**
2.  **Second place** and **1,000 XCP** will be awarded to **SoGParty**
3.  **Third place** and **250 XCP** will be awarded to both **XCP DEX** and **XCP Wallet**

Congratulations to the winners and thanks to all the participants and everyone who voted and donated to the community pool. We’re very excited to see this kind of innovative development in the Counterparty ecosystem and hope to have more development contests in the future.
