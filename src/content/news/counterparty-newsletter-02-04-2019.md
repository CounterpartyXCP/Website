It’s the crypto winter, the polar vortex has forced some of our favourite projects indoors as they bide their time, whilst others tease some updates for us this month:

**Ecosystem Updates:**  

-------------------------

**Indiesquare** is working on a new project to help games send Counterparty tokens with low fees. The project remains highly protective in what it can reveal right now but promises to reveal more information soon.

**Mandel Duck** will similarly be developing games that utilize this tech, so stay tuned for more information as it comes!

**Mafia Wars** started the month with their [8th distribution](https://mafiawars.io/news/mafiacash-distribution-8) of MAFIACASH. The team celebrated a huge month with over 200 players joining the game this month! Among the families, the Colombo family emerged the strongest with 77 new members. Check out more info in the jump above, alongside more info on the distributions [here](https://mafiawars.io/distributions).

In the past month, the Mafia Wars team have hosted card giveaways via their twitter [handle](https://twitter.com/mafiawars_io). With lots of new designs and monthly design contests, this is hopefully a tradition that will follow through to the coming months.

You can now trade your Mafia Wars collection within Book of Orbs [here](https://app.bookoforbs.com/Xps1hqbcR8t).

**BitCrystals** has revealed that you can now [buy](https://tokenmarkets.com/catalog/bitcrystalsofficial?fbclid=IwAR1244aYb3aMVce4GJFeUpA1XWLLyafmtQGRIqspT25WBKqlTcM997UVTpY) the BitCrystals token with both BTC and ETH.

With another addition to the CrystalsCraft collection, Joey Chips’ ‘CRYPTOARTATM’ is available via [Book of Orbs](https://app.bookoforbs.com/cry/CRYPTOARTATM?fbclid=IwAR0rImIgcXFQePKQC65NrWyaWRiuoW4vr-FnrxNg7mPoZm0UqZ-jdCfpq84) now.

**FoldingCoin** has has a quieter month after a taking a series of progressive steps for the project which you can check out [here](https://foldingcoin.net/). Still, the team has announced via their Twitter handle that the 3rd venue to accept their FLDC token is an art venue. As art holds a beloved place within the crypto community, you can check out Lynx Art, a Floridian based company [here](https://lynxartcollection.com/). Make sure to check out the Folding Coin [twitter handle](https://twitter.com/FoldingCoin) for further updates as and when they are released.

**Augmentors** posted their [review](https://medium.com/augmentors/looking-at-q1-and-q2-overview-of-development-plans-for-the-month-and-competition-finalists-6b38c1f0c22e) of Q1 and Q1 as they entered the new year. With an official roadmap that was most recently released [here](https://medium.com/augmentors/development-update-and-q1-q2-roadmap-community-update-january-25-2019-68b051b9bf3e), the team hosted a screenshot contest that kept players busy. You can check out the results [here](https://medium.com/augmentors/announcing-the-best-epicbattle-screenshot-winners-community-update-january-18-2019-c71c69cf0308). In the update, the team announced that with the upcoming open beta, they’ll be updating the game every couple of weeks,

**Age of Rust** has been a longterm feature in the Counterparty newsletters, but in case you need an introduction, the team shared an awesome introductory piece via their twitter handle. The medium article titled; “Age of Rust — Who?, What?, Where?, When?”, follows Age of Rust through its beggings to now, creating a great timeline for fans and newcomers alike, highlighting the Counterparty protocols role throughout. [Check it out.](https://medium.com/@silver_anth/age-of-rust-who-what-where-when-8f4c933a6ada)

With a quiet news cycle this month, [JScrilla](https://twitter.com/ScrillaVentura) posted his 2018 recap of CryptoArt and music featuring some Counterparty projects. The[post](https://hackernoon.com/my-2018-cryptoart-music-recap-12c8aa45a22d) features the ‘Art on the Blockchain’ podcast that in itself features so big Counterparty community influencers.

Also featured, is the Rare Art Festival and Bitcorn Crops.

### **Development News:**  


All exchanges and main ecosystem actors have updated successfully to Counterparty 9.56.0 and that Developers are currently working towards the next set of features for 9.57.0.

###  **Here is a reminder of current and future CIPs:**   

  
**CIP 6 - P2SH data encoding:**  
P2SH data encoding will allow Counterparty to utilize more space for transactions. CIP 6 will be beneficial to large transactions and is a prerequisite in supporting some of the more advanced send types, such as multi-peer-multi-asset (MPMA) and Multiparty Counterparty Aggregate Transactions (MCAT).  
  
CIP 10 - Multi-Peer Multi-Asset Sends (MPMA):**  
Multi-Peer Multi-Assets sends will allow many assets to be sent to many peers in a single transaction, simplifying batch transactions, and reducing transaction fees even further.  
  
  
**CIP 13 - Multiparty Counterparty Aggregate Transactions (MCAT):**  
MCAT will allow Counterparty users to group their transactions with those of other Counterparty users, to reduce their send costs considerably. Most users will be able to utilize this feature to send transactions for less than the cost of a single bitcoin transaction.  
  
CIP 13 will also allow Counterparty users to utilize MCAT nodes, to send assets across the Counterparty Network, and pay for the transaction fees in an asset other than BTC.  
  
Counterparty is an open-source, community-funded project which progresses solely through the generous time and monetary donations of others.
