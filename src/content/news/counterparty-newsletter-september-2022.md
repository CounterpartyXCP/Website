**<https://token.art/> - A NFT Showcase App**  
Want to show off your Tokens and NFTs you hold across multiple platforms (Ethereum, Solana, Cardano, WAX, Counterparty, and Dogeparty) all in one place. This is an app for iOS and Android from “[Awesome Labs](https://twitter.com/AwesomeLabsLLC)” which allows you to add multiple addresses and browse by collection.

Using your public address, this app avoids the need to enter your secret phrase or import any private keys, thus allowing you to avoid entering your secret phrase anywhere other than your main trusted devices.

Check out the information and direct download links here: <https://token.art/>

**\#weareallhodlonaut Fundraiser**  
The Counterparty community has stepped up and taken part in the Scarce City fundraiser to support community member [@hodlonaut](https://twitter.com/hodlonaut) with legal fees to defend his allegation that Craig Wright is not the identity of pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.

According to Scarce City’s “[Hodlonaut Donation Collection page](https://scarce.city/collections/hodlonaut-donation-collection)” over 2 BTC had been raised in total, with over 0.5 BTC (estimated) of that total generated by Counterparty backed lots.

Hodlonaut is due to take the stand and defend his allegations starting September 12. More details can be found on the website: <https://www.defendingbtc.com/>

**New community member resources** A Counterparty resource list has been pulled together by Dogeparty and Counterparty community member [@n0vaxNFT](https://twitter.com/n0vaxNFT). This is an excellent resource if you are just starting out with Counterparty or Dogeparty - or if you are new to either space a great place to start.

Temporarily hosted on Google drive - it will be relocated to its new home shortly. [You can find it here on Google Docs.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11RsfZ-lH58jqTcSljn40BLaUEhPqAXL7Lzu1oBuwFoM/edit)

**Counterparty.io updates** The [Counterparty.io/projects](http://counterparty.local/projects) list has recently been updated. Feel free to browse and visit projects using Counterparty. You may find something new that interests you!

If your project isn’t there, and you’d like it to be added - please contact <projects@counterparty.io> with a logo and a short description.

**FAQs to help**   
Don’t know your segwit from your metadata? Then watch out for a new resource coming soon to help newbies improve knowledge and provide answers to commonly asked questions. If you have any suggestions for questions, please drop us a line at <support@counterparty.io>.

Development Updates
-------------------

**Counterparty 9.60.0 released!** A new release of Counterparty had arrived. Version 9.60.0 introduces new features for Oracled Dispensers (CIP24) and Reset Token Divisibility for Unused Assets (CIP03), as well as the usual bunch of bug fixes and updates.

Oracle dispensers allow you to price a dispenser in a stable fiat currency (currently USD, JPY and EUR), and regardless of the fluctuation in Bitcoin, a dispense will occur when the matching value is received.

Reset Token Divisibility is now possible if you are the owner of the asset, you own 100% of the supply and the asset is not locked.

For more detailed information on how to update your Counterparty Federated Node, see the [news article](http://counterparty.local/news/counterparty-lib-9-60-0/).

**Counterparty Improvement Proposals (CIPs)** CIPs exist to give the development and user community a voice in the future of Counterparty features. More info can be found at <https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/cips>. If you have a great idea for improving the Counterparty experience, please get in touch.
