The 2016 Counterparty Foundation has been busy the past couple of weeks. We have several changes to announce that came out of our first meeting:

The first **Counterparty Community Meeting** will be held on June 1st. These community meetings will be held once per month on the first Wednesday of the month. The meeting will be held on Google Hangouts with real-time input from [Slack](http://slack.counterparty.io/). An agenda will be posted to Slack a few days before.

The **Counterparty.io Website** is undergoing a content refresh to be more clear regarding what Counterparty is, as well as talk to the exciting new features on the horizon. In this vein, the **[Japanese Counterparty Community](https://news.bitcoin.com/japan-dominate-bitcoin-landscape/)** is growing rapidly and we want to improve our tools for Japanese users! Counterparty.io will soon be adding bounties for a Japanese and Chinese site translation.

As the community continues to grow, we are seeing the various **Counterparty Communication Channels** begin to specialize. We now have a [BitcoinTalk forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=395761.12400), [subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/counterparty_xcp), a [subverse](https://voat.co/v/Counterparty), a [telegram chat](https://telegram.me/Counterparty), a [Counterparty specific forum](https://counterpartytalk.org/), [Slack](http://slack.counterparty.io/), and a Skype channel. Slack is being used as a real-time communication hub for the project, with moderated discussion. Consequently, a short list of Slack guidelines is under construction. If you have comments or suggestions for guidelines reach out to a Counterparty Director. Telegram and Skype will continue to be the communication methods with the most minimal moderation.

An **O****utreach Group** was created internally to improve content distribution to the community. An emphasis is being placed on raising awareness within the broader Bitcoin and Ethereum communities. More information on this will be forthcoming in a separate announcement.

**Counterparty Gear**, previously hosted at counterpartyfoundation.org, is being revamped with a new website. Additional information will be forthcoming.

The **[Counterparty Foundation Membership Program](http://counterpartyfoundation.org/join/)** is being wound down due to the Board’s assessment of the project’s ability to deliver on all of the stated benefits. As part of this, we will be offering a full refund to any current members who ask. If you have an existing membership, contact a board member for additional information.

And finally, **Robby Dermody**, one of the co-founders of Counterparty, was designated as chairman of the Counterparty Foundation for the current one year term.

We’re looking forward to seeing you all on our Community Meeting! Feel free to reach out to us on [Slack](http://slack.counterparty.io/) with any questions, comments, or concerns.
