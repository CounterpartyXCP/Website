It’s been a quiet month all round for the Counterparty community. Nevertheless, check out the updates below.

**Ecosystem Updates:**

The GENOVESE family lost a member but still maintained their number 2 ranking. The Mafia Wars team is continuously promoting new card designs via their twitter handle. You can find out more information on how to purchase them [here](https://mafiawars.io/news/mafiacash-distribution-10)as well as check some out below:

Spells of Genesis players can now use the BitCrystals currency (BCY) to purchase one of the in-game currencies; [Gems.](https://blog.spellsofgenesis.com/purchase-of-gems-with-bcy-available/)Previously, Gems could only be bought using fiat currencies, and allow players to purchase speciality card packs and refill their stamina during gameplay. Spells of Genesis also celebrated the sale of more than 40,000 cards via Book of Orbs.

**Augmentors** continues to engage its community with some major news over the past month. The game has temporarily been removed from the app store whilst the team rehauls the game as a whole; following feedback to make the game more engaging and fun. The main point of focus for the team is to increase user retention within the game and VR experience, and as a result, any roadmapped blockchain progress has also been delayed.

Two upcoming improvements to the game include the feature that allows for multiple creatures in battle, as well as the testing of turn mechanics to determine which creature will feature first in a battle and how often.

This is currently dependent on the creature’s speed. Existing and new creatures in the game are also being redeveloped to be more unique. You can check out all of the team’s community updates [here](https://medium.com/augmentors/augmentors-development-update-march-20-2019-37e7beb67c23).

**Age of Rust** follows on from last month as their [social media](https://twitter.com/SpacePirate_io) recaps their presence at San Francisco’s Game Developer’s Conference (GDC).

The team also highlighted how the project was getting some attention in Korea:

Development news is quiet this month as our team continues to work on the current CIPs as listed below:

  
  
**CIP 6 - P2SH data encoding:**  
P2SH data encoding will allow Counterparty to utilize more space for transactions. CIP 6 will be beneficial to large transactions and is a prerequisite in supporting some of the more advanced send types, such as multi-peer-multi-asset (MPMA) and Multiparty Counterparty Aggregate Transactions (MCAT).  
  
CIP 10 - Multi-Peer Multi-Asset Sends (MPMA):**  
Multi-Peer Multi-Assets sends will allow many assets to be sent to many peers in a single transaction, simplifying batch transactions, and reducing transaction fees even further.  
  
  
**CIP 13 - Multiparty Counterparty Aggregate Transactions (MCAT):**  
MCAT will allow Counterparty users to group their transactions with those of other Counterparty users, to reduce their send costs considerably. Most users will be able to utilize this feature to send transactions for less than the cost of a single bitcoin transaction.  
  
CIP 13 will also allow Counterparty users to utilize MCAT nodes, to send assets across the Counterparty Network, and pay for the transaction fees in an asset other than BTC.  
  
Counterparty is an open-source, community-funded project which progresses solely through the generous time and monetary donations of others.
