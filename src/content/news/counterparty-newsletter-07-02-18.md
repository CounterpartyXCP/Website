Ecosystem Updates
-----------------

It’s been a quiet month in the Counterparty community this past month but a couple of significant and exciting updates from some projects in the space have finally been announced! Check them out below!

**Spells of Genesis** followed up their recent monthly June campaign by announcing their [July Wizardry campaign.](https://blog.spellsofgenesis.com/july-wizardry-monthly-campaign/) With this month’s campaign, the difficulty of the Dark creator level - of which players are required to pass - has been reduced. With 7 cards available as player rewards, alongside gold rewards, the campaign comes alongside Spells of Genesis’ 1.2.17 update. The update is mainly cosmetic but also includes bug fixes to help users with their in-app experience.

The Spells of Genesis team also recently published two articles to help with user gameplay experience. The first, a [Blockchainization beginners guide](https://blog.spellsofgenesis.com/blockchainization-in-spells-of-genesis/), contains an infographic for users to jump-to whenever they need more information on how to store their in-game cards in a decentralized wallet; such as Book of Orbs.

The second article provides a strategy guide to the boosts and bonuses within Spells of Genesis to assist users with gameplay. Check it out [here.](https://blog.spellsofgenesis.com/strategy-101-boosts-and-bonuses-in-spells-of-genesis/)

**BitCrystals** has big news this month with the announcement of Casa Tookan. Described by the BitCrystals team as the *“next generation multi-chain digital wallet”* the wallet will obviously provide multi-chain support with a road-mapped goal for atomic swaps in the near future.

With Book of Orbs already in their ecosystem, this step for BitCrystals will include 3rd party application involvement with an integrated browser, that helps projects who have faced complications with Apple policies due to blockchain and cryptocurrency regulations. Casa Tookan is set to launch this September; to read more click [here](https://bitcrystals.com/bitcrystals-to-release-a-next-generation-multi-chain-digital-wallet/).

In other news, the BitCrystals team has also released a tutorial on how to efficiently use the Book of Orbs marketplace, check it out [here](https://bitcrystals.com/documentation/use-the-market-header-on-book-of-orbs-web-app/). A new card; “Putrid Dragon Coin”, can also be found in the CrystalsCraft environment now.

**IndieSquare** has launched their ‘WebXCP’ standard recently. As mentioned last month, this protocol allows developers to make XCP web apps - tackling previous issues with unsecure web applications. Native iOS applications were secure, however, but are subject to app store review. Indiesquare developers point out that with this new standard, a developer can make a web application and ask IndieSquare Wallet to handle the sensitive information such as sign transactions and so on.

 In other news, an XCP DEX is now available within the IndieSquare mobile applications:

**SaruTobi Island** is delayed whilst lightning network payments are being added to the project. Mandel Duck - the project’s developer- also aims to release a web version of the SaruTobi universe; that utilizes lightning to ‘pay for play’ and to submit high scores.

You can learn more about SaruTobi Island [here](http://mandelduck.com/sarutobiisland/).

FoldingCoin will be spending the coming month writing grants and developing fundraising strategies; that includes the advocation of Counterparty’s benefits alongside those of blockchain technology. These benefit will be geared towards how the Counterparty protocol helps improve distributed computing and medical research such as Folding Coin’s associated Folding@Home project.

Those interested in FoldingCoin and these upcoming developments should join the upcoming public meeting on July 7th [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQvl9RBss6I).

**Age of Rust,** a 3D blockchain-based adventure game is set to publish 5 new clues via their [twitter account](https://twitter.com/spacepirate_io), for players of their [beta version](https://www.ageofrust.games/) to access weekly. The creators of the highly visual game with over 650,000 meters of designed space to explore are set to hold a contest for the best fan art with various counterparty tokens rewards. For more details, make sure to follow the project over on their twitter account.

**Augmentors** have a few updates for the community this month. The augmented reality game based upon blockchain technology regularly puts out narrative and development updates via their medium publication.

In a [post](https://medium.com/augmentors/store-levels-of-rarity-new-creatures-being-released-exclusively-on-discord-community-update-e421e1d9a6a) about levels of rarity in-game, the Augmentors’ team discusses how each creature in-game’s rarity is determined, based on the finite number of creature available. This applies to cards and reward portals in-game too.

In the [second post](https://medium.com/augmentors/augmentors-prelude-part-6-the-grid-community-update-june-29th-2018-fc3a6ccf9da3), Augmentors players can find useful hyperlinks to all previous narrative medium articles. This post, in particular, continues on with the Augmentors story, as well as, provides a countdown to the game’s alpha and [sign up](https://www.augmentorsgame.com/alpha-signup/).

In other news, Augmentors’ creative Director will be at ‘Start-Up Grind’ in Cape Town on July 4th.

The project also continues to regularly promote cards to be used in-game via their [social networks](https://twitter.com/mafiawars_io/).

Counterparty in the News: 
--------------------------

A fairly new public art wall - (where you can doodle for the cost of 1 Satoshi

)- named Satoshi’s place - has come up in the community. As a way to promote projects in the community, you can see if your favorite Counterparty project is on the wall [here](https://satoshis.place/).

Counterparty developer and Cryptogame developer Dan Anderson recently did an interview the ATL Blockchain about Counterparty tokens on the blockchain. Check it out [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXJnHpq916Q)

Cryptobit Games also posted an article recently covering the recent news regarding BitCrystals’’ ‘Casa Tookan’ announcement. The article covers UX design and improved accessibility for users. Check it out [here](https://cryptobitgames.com/bitcrystals-announces-new-blockchain-wallet/).

Coinpedia has provided a really in-depth and useful Counterparty tutorial recently. It’s a great piece to keep on-hand should you ever need it. Check it out [here](https://coinpedia.org/decentralized-exchange/counterparty-dex/).

Lastly, but just as importantly, we must caution the caution the Counterparty community about the WALLST, EDRACHMA, and MACROSSBONUS assets.

These assets are being used by scammers to trick people into logging into fake counterwallet sites. Please only use wallets listed on the counterparty.io website. Using any other wallets could result in loss of funds. <http://counterparty.local/wallets/>

Counterparty Development News:
------------------------------

Counterparty continues to thank you for your patience during this slower period and asks that you stay up to date with our social networks regarding CIP-related matters. In progressive news, Folding Coin has dedicated two developers to focus on improving Counterparty. These developers are currently becoming familiar with the protocol’s code base and will work towards CIP 6 and 10 as a priority in due course. Notes for meetings Dan Anderson recently held for interested developers to attend can be found [here](https://counterpartytalk.org/t/counterparty-developer-meeting-05-04-2018/4725).

Going forward, development status on future CIPs are as follows:

#### CIP 10 and CIP 6 are still subject to peer review and unfortunately, have no ETA. There is no ETA at this time for CIP 15 (segwit) but things should be moving forward given the above pledges - though it is welcome for review. You can stay up to date with current and future CIPs, as well as links to relevant GitHub pages via the Counterparty [donate](http://counterparty.local/donate/) page. 

[CIP 6](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/cips/blob/master/cip-0006.md) - P2SH data encoding

P2SH data encoding will allow Counterparty to utilize more space for transactions. CIP 6 will be beneficial to large transactions and is a prerequisite in supporting some of the more advanced send types, such as multi-peer-multi-asset (MPMA) and Multiparty Counterparty Aggregate Transactions (MCAT).

[CIP 10](https://github.com/chiguireitor/cips/blob/cip10/cip-0010.md) - Multi-Peer Multi-Asset Sends (MPMA)

Multi-Peer Multi-Assets sends will allow many assets to be sent to many peers in a single transaction, simplifying batch transactions, and reducing transaction fees even further.

[CIP 15](https://github.com/deweller/cips/blob/cip-15-segwit/cip-0015.md)- Segwit Support

Enabling Segwit support within Counterparty will enable users to spend less on transaction fees and enables potential future enhancements. Updating Counterwallet will allow users to choose if they want to send assets to a segwit enabled address or a traditional address.

#### CIPs planned for release this year:

[CIP 13](http://counterparty.local/donate/) - Multiparty Counterparty Aggregate Transactions (MCAT)

MCAT will allow Counterparty users to group their transactions with those of other Counterparty users, to reduce their sends costs considerably. Most users will be able to utilize this feature to send transactions for less than the cost of a single bitcoin transaction.

CIP 13 will also allow Counterparty users to utilize MCAT nodes, to send assets across the Counterparty Network, and pay for the transaction fees in an asset other than BTC.

Counterparty is an open-source, community-funded project which progresses solely through the generous time and monetary donations of others.

Again, please visit our[donations](http://counterparty.local/donate/) page to stay up to date on the current bounty and development status of any CIPS, and consider making a donation to support their continued development. Alternatively, please[share](https://www.facebook.com/CounterpartyXCP/) or[RT](https://twitter.com/CounterpartyXCP) Counterparty CIPs on social media so we can help fulfill them faster!

We have also recently opened up a press channel for any media inquiries and would ask any media outlets to contact <press@Counterparty.io>.
