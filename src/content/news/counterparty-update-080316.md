## **Ecosystem News**

The mobile app company known as **MandelDuck** recently added support for Counterparty tokens within the popular Bitcoin geocaching app known as Takara. This is not the first time MandelDuck has integrated Counterparty tokens within one of their games, another recent example is the game known as Sarutobi.

“At MandelDuck we are passionate about using cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to bridge the gap between the digital and physical. We love to develop games and apps that let users easily interact with Bitcoin and other currencies with limited technical knowledge and a low barrier to entry.”

MandelDuck and Spells of Genesis utilized Counterparty to create the first in-game assets that can be used across multiple games. This is a notable achievement that may be looked back on years from now as the beginning of a seismic shift in video game development. MandelDuck was also the first app creators to make use of IndieSquare’s [API tools](https://medium.com/@IndieSquare/bitcoin-geocaching-app-takara-integrates-counterparty-tokens-through-indiesquare-api-bfe1b82bf4a4#.n3veicris) which makes it easier to integrate Counterparty assets into other games in the future!

The prominent Japanese Bitcoin exchange, [Zaif Exchange](http://zaif.jp/), started trading XCP and Counterparty assets recently, including the exchange's Counterparty asset **ZAIF**. This is a great accomplishment for Counterparty’s goal of global adoption. IndieSquare released an update on this event that can be read [here](https://blog.indiesquare.me/major-japanese-exchange-zaif-embraces-counterparty-acc4a25b827#.8fm353s2l). More information about Zaif Exchange will be forthcoming.

“The **Storj** Team reports that we are nearing one month since the release of the Test Group C open beta. Storj devs are continuously releasing new version with improvements and bug fixes of both the Storj Share CLI and GUI which farmers use to offer their extra hard drive space for rent. People who want to participate can download the beta from [here](https://storj.io/share.html).

Also people can start trying out how to upload files to the Storj decentralized cloud bridge, quickstart instructions are [here](http://docs.storj.io/). We have a very active [community slack](https://storj.io/community.html ) where testers can ask for assistance and follow the project progress. Work continues on integrating micropayment channels. The first monthly rewards payout to participating farmers is being processed now and will be distributed shortly. In a future beta version micropayments will be automatically streamed to the farmers in near real-time.

Last week, the Storj team presented the project at the Node Summit event in San Francisco and showed off the decentralized storage network in action with a raspberry pi farming rig seen [here](https://twitter.com/storjproject/status/758459127215583237).” - The Storj Team

Building on the recent popularity of in-game assets and PokemonGo, Josh Jones has launched a Pokemon trading site that makes use of the Counterparty asset **Topcoin**. The site is not yet fully operational but the concept is promising and the first mover advantage seized will likely end up being valuable in the future. Check out the site [here](https://pgox.co/faq).

The next **Foldingcoin** monthly public meeting will be held on Sunday August 7th at 3pm EDT on google hangouts. Shaban Shaame of Spells of Genesis will be in attendance and anyone who wants to ask questions or attend should follow [@Foldingcoin](https://twitter.com/FoldingCoin) on twitter for further information.

## **Developer Updates**

Ruben is close to a first alpha release of **the EVM** with partial asset support. Some more time needs to be spend on documentation and tools to get people started first though.

Ruben also wrote a CIP on a new data encoding schema to support the increase in data that we'll need to store in the blockchain. More can be read [here](https://counterpartytalk.org/t/cip-proposal-p2sh-data-encoding/2169).
