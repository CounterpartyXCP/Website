We thank everyone who participated in the election and showed their support for the candidates and the foundation. The newly formed board will, among other things, hold regular monthly meetings discussing project goals, form public relations tasks groups and work with the development team to form quarterly project roadmaps. We’re excited to have Ryan, Bench, Duncan, Chris, and Osamu aboard the foundation and are certain they’ll make great contributions that are in the best interest of the Counterparty project and its community.
