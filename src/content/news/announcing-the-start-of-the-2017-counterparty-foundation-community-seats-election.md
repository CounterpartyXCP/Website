On May 1st last year, the Counterparty community [elected four Counterparty Foundation community directors](http://counterparty.local/news/xcp-2016-election-voting-is-closed-announcing-the-names-of-the-counterparty-foundation-community-directors/) to help shape the direction of the Counterparty project and grow the community around it. Candidates with most votes from the community were **Matt Young**, **Jeremy Johnson (J-Dog)**, **Koji Higashi** and **Trevor Altpeter**. With the term of one year now coming to an end, the Foundation is preparing for new elections and invites everyone to participate by nominating candidates to fill **four (4) Community Director seats**. The nomination period will last two weeks, from **April 3rd** till **April 17th**, and the nominations are to be submitted on our [official election thread](https://counterpartytalk.org/t/announcing-the-start-of-the-counterparty-foundation-2017-election-nomination-period-apr-3rd-apr-17th). Please note that candidacies published outside of the official thread will not be taken into account. The only requirement for the nomination is that the candidate hold at least **50 XCP** and prove this by broadcasting a message from his or her address with the name of the nominee. If you would like to nominate yourself or another candidate, please reply to the [official election thread](https://counterpartytalk.org/t/announcing-the-start-of-the-counterparty-foundation-2017-election-nomination-period-apr-3rd-apr-17th) with the following candidate information:

- First and Last name
- Bio
- Picture
- Bitcoin address (must have at least 50 XCP)
- Tx of the broadcast used to verify the ownership of 50 XCP

 Please note that the sitting board of directors, by a super-majority vote, may disqualify non-viable candidates from election (as per [https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/Documentation/pull/665](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/Documentation/pull/66)). On **April 17th**, names and addresses of all candidates will be published on the public Blockscan voting scoreboard. April 17th will also mark **the start of the two week long voting period** , from **April 17th till May 1st**, during which the community may vote for their favorite candidate(s). Voting will be based on broadcasting votes: users who want to give their votes to one or more candidates may do so by broadcasting a message with the following parameters:

1. text = XCPELECTION + Candidate Number
2. value = votes (with the sum total of the values being less than the balance of the source address at the end of the voting period)

 For more information on how to publish a broadcast read our [Broadcast Tutorial](http://counterparty.local/docs/broadcast/). After the two week long voting period, at the voting closing block, top three addresses that receive the highest number of votes will be announced as winners, and their owners receive Community Director positions for the term of one year. Details about voting and election will be published in future posts. For now, we invite everyone interested in participating in the election to submit nominations in the [nomination thread](https://counterpartytalk.org/t/announcing-the-start-of-the-counterparty-foundation-2017-election-nomination-period-apr-3rd-apr-17th).
