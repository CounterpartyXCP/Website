This month’s update is full of exciting updates, as projects within the Counterparty ecosystem continue to take progressive steps forwards within the community.

### **Ecosystem Updates:**  


**IndieSquare** has announced plans to launch their new lightning network supported wallet. Known as [Pebble Wallet](https://www.pebble.indiesquare.me/), IndieSquare aims to help integrate B<g class="gr_ gr_18 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" data-gr-id="18" id="18">itcoin</g> micropayments within projects.

Pebble Wallet is currently in beta and will feature a LAPP browser, allowing users to access lightning web apps such as [YALLs](https://yalls.org/) directly from within the wallet.

The beta version can be found via the [Pebble homepage](https://pebble.indiesquare.me).

**Mafia Wars** completed their 9th distribution of MAFIACASH this month; celebrating the final sale of all remaining family tokens from the token sale (exceeding 2,500XCP). The Colombo family gained the majority of new players this month, although the total number of players added to the game grew by over 330; totalling 900 so far. Adding to their success, Mafia Wars took the number 1 ranking on DigiRare in celebration. Furthermore, the team also released a new card. You can check out ‘the Undertaker’ and more news regarding the monthly distributions and card design contests [here](https://mafiawars.io/news/mafiacash-distribution-9.).

**BitCrystals** has some unfortunate news this past month. With some [tough decisions](https://bitcrystals.com/everdreamsoft-action-plan-update-bitcrystals-and-spells-of-genesis-in-2019/?fbclid=IwAR2p27jdacs-jU9smUZWTpbeIaDoUjZk7ho4dmd0L5aGFs067pnOBsJlUJc)having been made within the Everdreamsoft parent community - <g class="gr_ gr_6 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins replaceWithoutSep" data-gr-id="6" id="6">progression</g> on the development of Spells of Genesis has ceased for the time being. Monthly campaigns will also be removed as of March 8th. Taking a refocused initiative on Blockchain tools and end-user tools, Casa Tookan and Book of Orbs will remain, as the BitCrystals community continues to develop more blockchain tools.

The team is also working to get BitCrystals listed on several exchanges to allow for the selling, buying and trading of the token.

**FoldingCoin** has small news this month, with less than 20 days of their raffle initiative with CureCoin remaining. To learn more, click [here](https://1.shortstack.com/qlVt66).

**Augmentors** released a community update reviewing their tutorials and user engagement plans. With plans to weave more of the game's intricately told narrative into the game’s tutorials, the update moves on to discuss development plans for the game.

With plans to improve the AR technology for both iOS and Android, the Augmentors team have roadmapped improvements for UI and UX (user interface and experience) in the near future. Check out the rest of the update [here.](https://medium.com/augmentors/an-overview-of-our-new-tutorial-development-plans-update-f1e3aad3c045)

**Age of Rust** announced that they were heading to the GDC (Game Developers Conference this month in San Francisco. You can learn more about the conference, that takes place March 18-22 [here](https://www.gdconf.com/). Check out a demo the team put together for the event below:

The first piece of Counterparty news this month comes from an article discussing the tokenization of art of on two Bl<g class="gr_ gr_37 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" data-gr-id="37" id="37">ockchains</g>. In a continuation of the discussion of rare art, the piece compares art on the counterparty protocol vs Ethereum’s ERC-721. Counterparty is mentioned with an appreciative backstory regarding the protocol; giving a nod to the streamlined efficiency of the protocol in regards to making assets and distributing them. In terms of the author’s counterparty use, he mainstreams his asset use in tokenizing Digital art for collectable game items and art pieces in Bitcorn Crops and Mafia Wars. Ultimately, they cite both Ethereum and Counterparty as great protocols for Art scarcity. Multiple projects within the Counterparty community, such as Rare Pepe, Spells of Genesis and Book of Orbs, are listed as references for the piece. Check it out [here](https://medium.com/@cypherpunk/a-tale-of-two-tokens-my-experiments-and-experience-with-tokenization-of-art-f2ae6703d5ce).

The second piece of Counterparty news comes from Artnome entitled “How to Launch Your Own Blockchain Art Marketplace”; and discusses how the Blockchain is being developed to allow artists to tokenize their art without coding. For Counterparty traders, this tool is known as [Freeport.io](http://www.freeport.io) and is currently in its pre-alpha. Within the post, Joe Looney’s; who has created Freeport, Rare Pepe Wallet, draws a notable mention. Also mentioned is Dan Anderson’s DigiRare and Bitcorn Crops. Check out the piece [here](https://www.artnome.com/news/2019/2/27/blockchain-art-30-how-to-launch-your-own-blockchain-art-marketplace).

<g class="gr_ gr_69 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep" data-gr-id="69" id="69">Counterparty</g> is also highlighted via the newly formed #LNTorch campaign; created by Joe Looney and started in order to bring more awareness to the Counterparty community. More specifically involving cryptogoods, the Rare Pepe Wallet founder started the '#passtheDUTCHIE' campaign - wherein users on social media post their Counterparty address to receive the torch - to get news of the community circulating.

<Tweet id="https://twitter.com/wasthatawolf/status/1100792163762388994" />In other exciting news this past month, a Bitcoin satellite transmitted the first meme in space. With Rare Pepe doing the <g class="gr_ gr_5 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" data-gr-id="5" id="5">honors</g>, [Blockstream’s satellite](https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-satellite-rare-pepe-space/)sent an encrypted Pepe meme via the Lightning Network.

In another piece by Breaker Mag, Jessica Klein writes that on February 27th 2019, the image ‘Pimentoloaf’ was transmitted. She goes on to explain that Rare Pepes are rare because each card has a unique smart contract that dictates the supply of each card. Check out more [here](https://breakermag.com/greetings-to-the-first-rare-pepe-from-space/).

Other news this month surrounds the recent TAB conference. You can check out a recent Hodlcast with JScrilla; with nods to Bitcorn Crops below:

<Tweet id="https://twitter.com/sashahodler/status/1096872636498567169" />J Scrilla also wrote about his experience at the conference over on [Hacker Noon;](https://hackernoon.com/my-tab-recap-making-bitcoin-weird-again-thats-a-good-thing-399108df31b3) that mentions Bitcorn Crops and some references to Rare Pepe in regards to how mainstreaming Bitcoin fits in with Counterparty. Check it out at the jump.

### **Development News:**

In development news, Counterparty released a very important [Hotfix](http://counterparty.local/news/counterparty-lib-9-56-1/) this past month. Counterparty-lib 9.56.1 resolves an issue that would stop a Counterparty server from operating normally. Please upgrade as soon as possible.

####   
Counterparty’s current and future CIPs are as follows:**   


  
  
**CIP 6 - P2SH data encoding:**  
P2SH data encoding will allow Counterparty to utilize more space for transactions. CIP 6 will be beneficial to large transactions and is a prerequisite in supporting some of the more advanced send types, such as multi-peer-multi-asset (MPMA) and Multiparty Counterparty Aggregate Transactions (MCAT).  
  
CIP 10 - Multi-Peer Multi-Asset Sends (MPMA):**  
Multi-Peer Multi-Assets sends will allow many assets to be sent to many peers in a single transaction, simplifying batch transactions, and reducing transaction fees even further.  
  
  
**CIP 13 - Multiparty Counterparty Aggregate Transactions (MCAT):**  
MCAT will allow Counterparty users to group their transactions with those of other Counterparty users, to reduce their send costs considerably. Most users will be able to utilize this feature to send transactions for less than the cost of a single bitcoin transaction.  
  
CIP 13 will also allow Counterparty users to utilize MCAT nodes, to send assets across the Counterparty Network, and pay for the transaction fees in an asset other than BTC.  
  
Counterparty is an open-source, community-funded project which progresses solely through the generous time and monetary donations of others.
