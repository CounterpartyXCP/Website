It has been a quiet month in the Counterparty sphere but nevertheless, substantial. Check out the updates below:

Ecosystem News:
---------------

**IndieSquare** was among other blockchain adopters, Everdreamsoft at this year’s Tokyo Game Show this past month. There, the team demonstrated their new web standard API onboard with present developers; alongside their new SDK (Software Developer Kits).

**Mafia Wars** just celebrated their 3rd distribution of MAFIACASH last month. The game of idle accumulation set within the context of mob families saw (as mentioned) the 3rd distribution of MAFIACASH over 5 families within its game in September. Alongside the distribution, Mafia Wars released family rankings for the month, reminding players that to increase their monthly distributions and rankings (and grow their families) then they need to purchase cards from [‘the black market’](https://mafiawars.io/news/mafiacash-distribution-3).

The Team recently launched the game at ComicCon Africa but has no plans of slowing down with the Q4 section of their [projected roadmap](https://medium.com/augmentors/high-level-plan-for-q4-development-update-friday-5th-october-2018-e7eaab70bca2) fast approaching.

Counterparty in the News:
-------------------------

In Counterparty news this month an article on [Cryptobriefing.com](https://cryptobriefing.com/the-6-best-blockchain-games-and-why-they-will-get-better/) features Spells of Genesis and Augmentors in their rankings for the 6 best cryptogames.

Holding the top two positions respectively, the slight yet adjoining critique of the games that follow seem out of place and contradictory, but provide concise summaries of the gaming styles and contexts regardless.

The article itself addresses blockchain’s need to (still) earn its place in the gaming platform universe. Discussing the scalability issues surrounding blockchain and the existing projects in the gaming world that have adopted it, the body of text focuses on critiquing the ethereum blockchain whilst listing two projects with strong roots in the counterparty protocols (it is important to note, however, that they have since developed ties to ethereum) as the highest ranking games to use blockchain technologies.

Augmentors garners another mention in an article on the use and potential success of Dapps (decentralized apps) in gaming.

The [article](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-adoption-fallacy-decentralized-applications/) discusses the weakness of DApps in their current formats before concluding that they will potentially find the most success on web formats such as Augmentors has demonstrated with their recent launch.

Counterparty Development Updates 
---------------------------------

This past month, Counterparty protocol developers have reviewed and processed more than 50 pull requests in regards to [CIP 19](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/cips/blob/master/cip-0019.md). Moreover, the Counterparty protocol was updated to Bitcoin 0.16.3 meaning CIP 19, unfortunately, missed its target of meeting 0.16.2 due to this update. However, a PR was merged to use it.

Despite recent delays over the last year, Counterparty is accepting [CIP requests](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/cips)and reviewing PRs such as CIP 6 and CIP 10.

Please stay up to date with our social networks regarding any other CIP-related matters. A reminder of the CIPs are as follows: **[CIP 6](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/cips/blob/master/cip-0006.md) - P2SH data encoding:** P2SH data encoding will allow Counterparty to utilize more space for transactions. CIP 6 will be beneficial to large transactions and is a prerequisite in supporting some of the more advanced send types, such as multi-peer-multi-asset (MPMA) and Multiparty Counterparty Aggregate Transactions (MCAT).  [CIP 10](https://github.com/chiguireitor/cips/blob/cip10/cip-0010.md) - Multi-Peer Multi-Asset Sends (MPMA):** Multi-Peer Multi-Assets sends will allow many assets to be sent to many peers in a single transaction, simplifying batch transactions, and reducing transaction fees even further. **[CIP 15](https://github.com/deweller/cips/blob/cip-15-segwit/cip-0015.md)- Segwit Support:** Enabling Segwit support within Counterparty will enable users to spend less on transaction fees and enables potential future enhancements. Updating Counterwallet will allow users to choose if they want to send assets to a segwit enabled address or a traditional address.

**CIPs planned for release this year:** **[CIP 15](https://github.com/deweller/cips/blob/cip-15-segwit/cip-0015.md) - Multiparty Counterparty Aggregate Transactions (MCAT):** MCAT will allow Counterparty users to group their transactions with those of other Counterparty users, to reduce their send costs considerably. Most users will be able to utilize this feature to send transactions for less than the cost of a single bitcoin transaction. CIP 13 will also allow Counterparty users to utilize MCAT nodes, to send assets across the Counterparty Network, and pay for the transaction fees in an asset other than BTC. Counterparty is an open-source, community-funded project which progresses solely through the generous time and monetary donations of others.
