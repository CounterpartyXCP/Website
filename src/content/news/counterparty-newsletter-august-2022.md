**Coffeeparty - a global 24/7 party for coffee connoisseurs the world over**   
Good news for those that like coffee.The first Counterparty-based COFFEEPARTY has been created by Rare Pepe News ([@rarepepetrader](https://t.me/rarepepetrader)). Having relocated his family from Sydney to Banyuwangi, East Java, he now has access to coffee beans direct from growers and specific varieties from around Indonesia.

All beans are selected by the Founder of COFFEEPARTY, Bradley C Hughes, in consultation with Master Roasters. The beans will initially be sourced from Java, Indonesia and roasted by Master Roaster Mr Emir Yusuf in Banyuwangi, East Java.

The price of admission to be one of the 100 Founding Members of the COFFEEPARTY is 0.01 BTC. This membership provides 60 x 200g packets of delicious coffee beans, providing a different roasted coffee bean every month over a maximum five year redemption period. You can choose to have between 1 and 5 packets per month, reducing your redemption period as you increase your coffee intake.

Each monthly packet frequency has its own shipping costs, which will be paid by purchasing the corresponding quantity of shipping tokens, with shipping token redemptions required monthly in advance. Shipping tokens will be issued per frequency, and per region, with shipping costs varying according to region/country.

Initial countries and regions supported are:  
Australia, EU - European Union, Indonesia, Israel, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, United Kingdom, United States of America

**Counterparty Improvement Proposals (CIPs)**

CIPs exist to give the development and user community a voice in the future of Counterparty features. More info can be found at <https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/cips>. A couple of notable updates:

**Reset Token &amp; Divisibility Statuses (CIP-0003)** is an improvement that allows owners of tokens to reset the issuance and divisibility if the asset owner holds all of the supply. It has now achieved 100% of its funding goal and will be included in the next release

**Oracled Dispensers (CIP-0024)** are imminent in the next release. These are dispensers/vending machines where you will be able to sell tokens for BTC, but price items in fiat (i.e. sell a card for $10 regardless of price of BTC)
