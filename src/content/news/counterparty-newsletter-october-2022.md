Development Updates
-------------------

**Freewallet 0.9.22 released!**

The latest release of Freewallet introduces functionality to take advantage of Oracled Dispensers and the ability to Reset Token Divisibility, in addition to a few bug fixes.

Download the latest version for you platform (Windows, MacOS, Linux) here: <https://freewallet.io/>

**Counterparty Improvement Proposals (CIPs)**

The latest CIP to be announced is the [Enhanced Asset Information Specification (CIP25)](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/cips/blob/master/cip-0025.md) which defines a standard set of attributes for storing media information about Tokens, and lays the way for a simple DNS redirection service.

Using a standard schema for defining asset information will make it easier to parse out these values programmatically and paves the way for easier integration into your website or project.

CIPs exist to give the development and user community a voice in the future of Counterparty features. More info can be found at <https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/cips>. If you have a great idea for improving the Counterparty experience, please get in touch.

Community Hangouts
