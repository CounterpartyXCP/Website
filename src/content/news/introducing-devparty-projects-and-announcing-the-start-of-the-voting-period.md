## ONOMA by sull

ONOMA is a Counterparty-compatible Asset-based Content, Identity and Reputation Platform.

With ONOMA you can create website for multiple verified Counterparty Assets and generate "Enhanced Asset" JSON metadata. Each asset has it's own content feed where asset owner can post updates to and has JSON/XML output.

Here are some of its features:

-   Uses Static Flat File system (JSON, XML) and No SQL database. Portable platform can upload to other servers and run without "installation", only some settings file changes.
-   User adds and verifies Bitcoin Addresses and XCP Asset Ownership prior to being able to create and use Asset Feeds or other Asset Transaction functionality.
-   Sites can have multiple users with their own Assets and Feeds.
-   Users can also create feeds unrelated to Assets for general content publishing.
-   Users can create RSS Aggregators (River of News) to compile various news sources into a single page with RSS and OPML outputs.
-   Supports Podcasting, Automatic Hashtag and Username linking, Microformats for Bitcoin Tips, QR Codes and other features.
-   Easy to extend and theme.
-   Integrated with following 3rd party services:
    -   Disqus.com - Comments on posts
    -   Tierion.com - Anchored Blockchain Receipts for posts and other transactions get stored on server in various ways and on Airtable DB.
    -   Airtable.com - Syncs to remote database service as backup or lightweight ledger depending on how it is implemented.
    -   Amazon S3 - Backup of static files etc.

Future plans:

-   Support All Counterparty Transactions Types within platform itself.
-   Export off-chain token transactions and Import to wallets for on-chain settlement flow.
-   Community features and integrated wallet
-   Blockchain Identity and Reputation Components
-   Update Design to be mobile-first with newer CSS frameworks.
-   General rewrite of code to evolve from "Prototype" to "Release Quality"

Demo is available at [https://ono.ma](https://ono.ma) while the source code can be accesses [here](https://github.com/sull/ONOMA-PUBLIC).
