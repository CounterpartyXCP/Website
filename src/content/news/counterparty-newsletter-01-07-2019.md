**BitCrystals** has had a quiet month with only an update from the Spells of Genesis team. This update involves an updated version of the game.

<Tweet id="https://twitter.com/MartyBent/status/1079800613880426497" />In a piece by Rare Pepe Wallet founder Joe Looney, “the real cost of Cryptogoods” discusses the altered value of tokens aka ‘cryptogoods’ depending on the platform. Going beyond gaming items, Looney’s work often includes nonfungible tokens and cryptoart too - mentioning that this emerging media can often be overwhelming to newcomers.

The article begins to discuss the platform and longevity of cryptogoods as a basis for its realness and value. He begins with a history lesson going back to 2015, citing Counterparty and the popularity of trading cards via the protocol on the bitcoin blockchain. This lesson draws popular mentions to projects such as Bitcorns and Rare Pepes.

With his definition that “a cryptogood is a token issued by an artist, game developer, musician, etc. that is generally represented by an image, video or text” Looney goes on to point out they are not representative of currencies or physical goods. After going on to discuss his original points - comparing the issuance of cryptogoods via Counterparty vs Ethereum - Looney ends rather open-ended with a fair warning to users not to get caught up in mass opinion. A worthwhile read, check it out [here](https://medium.com/@joelooney/the-real-cost-of-cryptogoods-dd156f5df056).

In other exciting news, the Rare Digital Art Festival is returning to New York on May 18th, 2019! Expanding on Looney’s article, “Rare digital art is a movement to take internet assets that have previously been infinitely copyable (songs, memes, etc) and turn them into provably rare, tradable blockchain assets”.

[Counterparty 9.56.0](http://counterparty.local/news/counterparty-lib-9-56-0/) was released just before the new year! Alongside immediate support for Segwit ([CIP15](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/cips/blob/master/cip-0015.md)) on testnet, and mainnet (which activated at block 557236). 9.56.0 is also updated to use Bitcoin Core 0.16.3 and includes the changes listed within [CIP19](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/cips/blob/master/cip-0019.md) as mentioned below (to replace the addrindex patch):

- Faster blockchain sync and parsing
- Segwit support for lower fees
- Hash Timelocked Contracts (HTLCs) which enable atomic swaps and lightning
- Better fee estimation

All users and projects within the Counterparty ecosystem are encouraged to have upgraded by today (January 7th, 2019) for the hardfork.

  
Again, here is a reminder of current and future CIPs, following this upgrade:

  
  
**CIP 6 - P2SH data encoding:**  
P2SH data encoding will allow Counterparty to utilize more space for transactions. CIP 6 will be beneficial to large transactions and is a prerequisite in supporting some of the more advanced send types, such as multi-peer-multi-asset (MPMA) and Multiparty Counterparty Aggregate Transactions (MCAT).  
  
CIP 10 - Multi-Peer Multi-Asset Sends (MPMA):**  
Multi-Peer Multi-Assets sends will allow many assets to be sent to many peers in a single transaction, simplifying batch transactions, and reducing transaction fees even further.  
  
  
**CIP 13 - Multiparty Counterparty Aggregate Transactions (MCAT):**  
MCAT will allow Counterparty users to group their transactions with those of other Counterparty users, to reduce their send costs considerably. Most users will be able to utilize this feature to send transactions for less than the cost of a single bitcoin transaction.  
  
CIP 13 will also allow Counterparty users to utilize MCAT nodes, to send assets across the Counterparty Network, and pay for the transaction fees in an asset other than BTC.  
  
Counterparty is an open-source, community-funded project which progresses solely through the generous time and monetary donations of others.
