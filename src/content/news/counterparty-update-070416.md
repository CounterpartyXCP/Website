## **Ecosystem News**

**TopCoin** is a Counterparty project created by Josh Jones, co-founder of DreamHost, and his partner Michael Blend. The project has been operating since [September of 2014](https://blockscan.com/assetinfo/TOPCOIN) but has largely been flying under the radar.

“Topcoin ("TPC") is the world’s only cryptocurrency designed specifically for digital goods loyalty programs. Consumers are rewarded TPC for domain name purchases made at partner companies in the TPC ecosystem, and those companies in turn accept up to half the purchase price of new domain name registrations in Topcoin at a value of $1 per TPC. The closest "real-world" analogy to TPC is frequent flyer miles, except that TPC may be used across a broad range of product classes and are easily exchanged for other currencies.”

“Topcoin is designed to disrupt customer loyalty-reward programs, an industry widely loved by consumers that has artificially high transaction costs. Like frequent flyer miles in the travel industry, Topcoin rewards purchasers of digital goods with currency that can be used to purchase additional related services. Topcoin’s initial applications are in the web site creation ecosystem, including domain names and web hosting.”

[Topcoin](https://topcoin.com/) is currently supported by domain registrar [Uniregistry](https://uniregistry.com/topcoin-faq) with a VPS service and other domain registries coming soon.

**IndieSquare Wallet** had a recent update that added the ability to choose your optimal transaction fee.

“An optimal transaction fee feature has been added to the latest version and the wallet calculates the optimal fee depending the level of network congestion. Also, you can choose from three priority levels(high, medium, low) for convenience. If you need to send the token as soon as possible, the high mode may make sense while the low mode may be better when you are sending out tokens for fun.”

This is a critical wallet feature due to rising transaction fees and Blockchain congestion. The full update can be read [here](https://medium.com/@IndieSquare/indiesquare-wallet-update-ver-0-9-5-optimal-transaction-fee-calculation-added-b357ad6ab2da#.fb6mfmgqe).

On June 22nd, **Storj** announced plans for Test Group C. This is the final test group before the full production launch of Storj later this summer!

“We’re delighted to announce Test Group C (TGC) - the last test group before a full launch later this summer. Test Group A generated usable data on network latency, disconnects, uptime, and other factors. Test Group B allowed us to assess farmer contributions, particularly uptime statistics and the total storage capacity of the network. TGC will test real world network conditions and we will reward TGC participants with a total of 1,000,000 SJCX for contributing storage capacity and telemetry data to the network over the next few months.”

The full Storj announcement can be read [here](http://blog.storj.io/post/146323281143/storj-test-group-c).
