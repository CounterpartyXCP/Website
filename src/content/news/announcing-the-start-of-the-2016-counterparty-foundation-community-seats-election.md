On April 19th last year, the Counterparty community [elected three Counterparty Foundation community directors](http://counterpartyfoundation.org/xcp-election-voting-is-closed-announcing-the-names-of-the-counterparty-foundation-community-directors/) to help shape the direction of the Counterparty project and grow the community around it. Candidates with most votes from the community were Devon Weller, Robert Ross and Chris Derose.

With the term of one year now coming to an end, the Foundation is preparing for new elections and invites everyone to participate by nominating candidates to fill three Community Director seats.

The nomination period will last two weeks, from **April 4th** till **April 18th**, and the nominations are to be submitted on our [official election thread](https://counterpartytalk.org/t/announcing-the-start-of-the-counterparty-foundation-2016-election-nomination-period-apr-4th-apr-18th/1950). Please note that candidacies published outside of the official thread will not be taken into account.

The only requirement for the nomination is that the candidate hold at least **50 XCP** and prove this by broadcasting a message from his or her address with the name of the nominee.

If you would like to nominate yourself or another candidate, please reply to the [official election thread](https://counterpartytalk.org/t/announcing-the-start-of-the-counterparty-foundation-2016-election-nomination-period-apr-4th-apr-18th/1950) with the following candidate information:

-   First and Last name
-   Bio
-   Picture
-   Bitcoin address (must have at least 50 XCP)
-   Tx of the broadcast used to verify the ownership of 50 XCP

Please note that the sitting board of directors, by a super-majority vote, may disqualify non-viable candidates from election (as per [https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/Documentation/pull/665](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/Documentation/pull/66)).

On **April 18th**, the Executive Director will generate a Bitcoin address for each candidate that meets the requirement. Names and addresses of all candidates will be published on the public Blockscan voting scoreboard. April 18th will also mark **the start of the two week long voting period** , from **April 18th till May 2nd**, during which the community may vote for their favorite candidate(s).

Voting will be based on broadcasting votes: users who want to give their votes to one or more candidates may do so by broadcasting a message with the following parameters:

1.  text = XCPELECTION + Candidate Number
2.  value = votes (with the sum total of the values being less than the balance of the source address at the end of the voting period)

For more information on how to publish a broadcast read our [Broadcast Tutorial](http://counterparty.local/docs/broadcast/).

After the two week long voting period, at the voting closing block, top three addresses that receive the highest number of votes will be announced as winners, and their owners receive Community Director positions for the term of one year.

Details about voting and election will be published in future posts. For now, we invite everyone interested in participating in the election to submit nominations in the nomination thread [link] and join us in our dedicated [#Election2016 Slack channel](https://counterparty.slack.com/messages/election2016/).
