Ecosystem Updates
-----------------

**IndieSquare** has hired Counterparty protocol developers to help with development and research into token scaling solutions such as lightning network and/or side chains, to help improve and work toward the ever-progressing state of IndieSquare’s desktop and wallet capabilities. In recent news, Indiesquare has made a focused move to also provide more English language user support in order to further assist with the wallet and the app’s new discover environment.

**Blockchainizator** has four of their collections, that have previously been tradeable in Book of Orbs with the BitCrystals economy; available in Mafia Wars.

**Mafia Wars** itself recently added these AtoMo cards alongside other notable collections (BitCrystal’s CrystalsCraft) as part of 178 cards, new to their game of idle accumulation.

In FoldingCoin development news, the team released version 1.1.1 - which resolved a date-time format change that affected parsing. To further fund their development expenses, the team are driving several funding initiatives and are actively applying for grants that, unfortunately, can take some time.

However, development has since wrapped up on the FoldingCoin donation website that now links to the FoldingCoin homepage. Alongside this, the FoldingCoin team is launching a GoFundMe campaign in the coming days, so keep an eye on the FoldingCoin [twitter](https://twitter.com/foldingcoin) for more information and spread the word!

In an [article](https://medium.com/kaleidoscope-xcp/the-early-evolution-of-art-on-the-blockchain-part-1-d52d1454e34b)published this past month via medium entitled “the Early Evolution of Art on the Blockchain - Part 1” Counterparty draws focus as it details the history of art on the blockchain; mentioning EverdreamSoft, and the first piece of blockchain art within EverdreamSoft’s gaming universe. Also drawing a mention is Sarutobi, as the timeline continues on before ending up most notably, with Rare Pepe.

Elsewhere, in Tokyo, a Sakebar has made news for accepting XCP as a currency. Whilst Japan is known for having a more mainstream adoption of Bitcoin in comparison to other countries, this self-regulation of cryptocurrency proves promising for Japan’s loyal crypto following.

**Development News:**
---------------------

Development news this month centers mainly around segwit support, as well as, furthers the progress that will aid in the future development of CIPs:

- Counterwallet changes for segwit support
- Federated node changes for segwit support
- Regtest support was added for easier testing of new counterparty features
- Testing underway for segwit counterwallet support.

Thank you for your continued support and patience as Counterparty developers tackle each CIP in due course. Here is a reminder of current and future CIPs:

 **CIP 6 - P2SH data encoding:** P2SH data encoding will allow Counterparty to utilize more space for transactions. CIP 6 will be beneficial to large transactions and is a prerequisite in supporting some of the more advanced send types, such as multi-peer-multi-asset (MPMA) and Multiparty Counterparty Aggregate Transactions (MCAT).  CIP 10 - Multi-Peer Multi-Asset Sends (MPMA):** Multi-Peer Multi-Assets sends will allow many assets to be sent to many peers in a single transaction, simplifying batch transactions, and reducing transaction fees even further. **CIP 15- Segwit Support:** Enabling Segwit support within Counterparty will enable users to spend less on transaction fees and enables potential future enhancements. Updating Counterwallet will allow users to choose if they want to send assets to a segwit enabled address or a traditional address.

**CIPs planned for future release:**

 **CIP 13 - Multiparty Counterparty Aggregate Transactions (MCAT):** MCAT will allow Counterparty users to group their transactions with those of other Counterparty users, to reduce their send costs considerably. Most users will be able to utilize this feature to send transactions for less than the cost of a single bitcoin transaction. CIP 13 will also allow Counterparty users to utilize MCAT nodes, to send assets across the Counterparty Network, and pay for the transaction fees in an asset other than BTC. Counterparty is an open-source, community-funded project which progresses solely through the generous time and monetary donations of others.
