Counterparty Development News:
------------------------------

In Development news this month, the Counterparty continues to contribute alongside our developers to work on the current CIPs and protocol.

For instance, the FoldingCoin team has recently completed [CIP 0001](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/cips/blob/master/cip-0001.md) and [CIP18](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/cips/blob/cip18/cip-0018.md) has been proposed to reduce developer burdens for a private counterparty server that needn’t limit the number of rows returned by API calls. This same CIP will provide a mechanism to then reduce the number of results a public server allows to be served on each call. As a result, the required bandwidth will be reduced in highly used servers. You can read more about this in Counterparty Talk’s [CIP thread](https://counterpartytalk.org/t/cip-proposal-18-configuration-flag-to-remove-api-query-limit-defaults/5017).

Again, please stay up to date with our social networks regarding any other CIP-related matters. Notes for meetings Dan Anderson recently held for interested developers to attend can be found [here](https://counterpartytalk.org/t/counterparty-developer-meeting-05-04-2018/4725).

#### You can stay up to date with current and future CIPs, as well as links to relevant GitHub pages via the Counterparty [donate](http://counterparty.local/donate/) page. 

[CIP 6](https://github.com/CounterpartyXCP/cips/blob/master/cip-0006.md) - P2SH data encoding

P2SH data encoding will allow Counterparty to utilize more space for transactions. CIP 6 will be beneficial to large transactions and is a prerequisite in supporting some of the more advanced send types, such as multi-peer-multi-asset (MPMA) and Multiparty Counterparty Aggregate Transactions (MCAT).

[CIP 10](https://github.com/chiguireitor/cips/blob/cip10/cip-0010.md) - Multi-Peer Multi-Asset Sends (MPMA)

Multi-Peer Multi-Assets sends will allow many assets to be sent to many peers in a single transaction, simplifying batch transactions, and reducing transaction fees even further.

[CIP 15](https://github.com/deweller/cips/blob/cip-15-segwit/cip-0015.md)- Segwit Support

Enabling Segwit support within Counterparty will enable users to spend less on transaction fees and enables potential future enhancements. Updating Counterwallet will allow users to choose if they want to send assets to a segwit enabled address or a traditional address.

#### CIPs planned for release this year:

[CIP 13](http://counterparty.local/donate/) - Multiparty Counterparty Aggregate Transactions (MCAT)

MCAT will allow Counterparty users to group their transactions with those of other Counterparty users, to reduce their sends costs considerably. Most users will be able to utilize this feature to send transactions for less than the cost of a single bitcoin transaction.

CIP 13 will also allow Counterparty users to utilize MCAT nodes, to send assets across the Counterparty Network, and pay for the transaction fees in an asset other than BTC.

Counterparty is an open-source, community-funded project which progresses solely through the generous time and monetary donations of others.

Again, please visit our[donations](http://counterparty.local/donate/) page to stay up to date on the current bounty and development status of any CIPS, and consider making a donation to support their continued development. Alternatively, please[share](https://www.facebook.com/CounterpartyXCP/) or[RT](https://twitter.com/CounterpartyXCP) Counterparty CIPs on social media so we can help fulfill them faster!

We have also recently opened up a press channel for any media inquiries and would ask any media outlets to contact <press@Counterparty.io>.
